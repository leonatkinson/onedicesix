    countryside in a great wave {5d4} feet high. The wave is {1d100+100} feet wide,
    centered about the riverbed of its source. The wave rushes downstream for
    {1d6} miles before losing force. It can easily snap trees, tear down
    buildings, and sweep men away. All those caught in the path of the wave
    are swept downstream to their deaths unless they have some type of raft
    or other flotation device. After this passes the water level quickly falls

    known to the local peasants. They do not attack the monster, afraid of its
    power. If the monster is not defeated or driven away soon, the villagers
    make offerings to it as an evil god, hoping to appease it. In addition,
    others of its type appear in the same area and the infestation
    becomes stronger.

table: major-incursion 1d1

    in the playing of musical instruments and other artistic accomplishments.
    She is properly respectful of her parents (if she has any). If the maiden
    is any but the daughter of a powerful noble, she can be courted
    (and possibly wed) without the full formalities. However, being aware
    (but not vain) of her own qualities, she does not accept just anyone. Her
    accepted suitor must possess exceptional qualities of his own. He must also
    be a model of virtue and likewise skilled in the arts. He must possess heroic
    qualities. To even attract her notice, he must produce some artistic item of
    quality-a poem, painting, exceptional handwriting, etc. He must have a
    Charisma of at least 13. Maidens of mysterious origin or princesses may set
    impossible tasks as a condition for any successful suitor. The social rank

table: maneater 1d1
1   A {maneater-creature} has acquired a taste for human flesh and is raiding
    the local villages, carrying off women, children, and farmers in their
    fields. The animal strikes once or twice a week, killing its prey and
    dragging it off into the woods. The villagers are paralyzed by fear,
    unwilling to venture outside alone or after dark. They petition the
    government, a powerful NPC, or the player characters for aid. The maneater
    remains active until captured or killed.

1   leopard
2   tiger
3   wolf

    those of neighboring lands are suspicious of strangers. Traders do not enter
    plagued lands and the cost of imported goods increases five times. The cost
    of normal goods doubles. Each month, {5d5}% of population centers become
    infected and {6d5}% of population centers rid themselves of the disease.

table: recruiting 1d1
1   Men are needed to shoulder arms and special measures are taken to recruit
    soldiers. These include enforced levies of peasants, bounties offered to

    taken. {troop-arrest} Friendly troops do not engage in wholesale pillaging

    to the other rural areas. The peasants arm themselves with whatever is at
    hand--farm implements and weapons they have gathered from fighters they
    have hunted down. Only 10% of the peasants involved have proper armor.
    {uprising-support} The peasants have no military plan or strategy, simply
    attacking and ambushing any troops and officials of the government they
    find. If a strong leader should arrive in their midst, they can be trained
    into an effective fighting force in {2d2} months. Of course, uprisings are
    dealt with severely by the government and reinforcement troops are
    dispatched to deal with them. No mercy or quarter is shown, a fact that
    causes the peasants to fight to the death. {uprising-outcome}
