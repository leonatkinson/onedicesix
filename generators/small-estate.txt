# Outside
table: outside
1   A stout wall built of smooth stone encircles a square plot approximately 150'
    per side. Every 25' a thick column further fortifies the wall, which is 15'
    tall. The only visible entrance is through a gate in the south wall. Beyond
    the gate is a small estate containing three small buildings, a 10' wide road
    circling a fenced area and a two-story house.
2   A crumbling wall barely contains a 150'x150' plot. Between stout columns, the
    wall often falters, allowing easy access to the grounds within. Now pointless,
    a wrought iron gate once served as the only entrance. Inside the crumblins
    walls are three small buildings, a 10' wide road circling a fenced area and
    a two-story house.

# Gate
table: area1
1   A rusting chain holds two iron gates together with a padlock. Adjust lockpicking
    attempts by {1d20-10}% due to corrosion. {area1_decoration}
2   Iron gates have fallen from their hinges. Weeds grow up through their decaying
    rods. {area1_decoration}
3   Corroded iron gates are fixed in place with a series of heavy posts. A jumble
    of rotting boards obscure view to inside the walls. {area1_decoration}

table: area1_decoration 1d10

6   A sign declares "Danger! Keep Out!"
7   "DEAD INSIDE" is painted in red letters.
8   A small shrine including a holy symbol and dried flowers sits next to the gate.
9   A black fungus grows over scattered bones.
10  {1d6+2} gold coins peak out from a half-rotten bag.

# Carriage House
table: area2
1   Stone shingles keep the rain out of a 20'x20' carriage house. Double doors
    swing easily to reveal a small carriage in serviceable condition. A small door
    on the east side, slight ajar, also allows entrance. {area2_monster}{break2}
    {area2_treasure}
2   A good portion of the stone shingles atop this 20'x20' carriage house have
    tumbled and shattered, allowing damaging rain pour over a a small carriage
    found beyond two doors. The right wheels of the carriage have fallen away,
    leaving the vehicle to rest at a disturbed angle. {area2_monster}{break2}

# Hut
table: area3
1   Weeds grow from a mound of soil in a long-discarded wheelbarrow beside a
    10'x10' hut. The stuck door requires significant force to open. Inside, a
    meager living space contains a bed and a few personal effects, all untouched
    for some time. An elf skeleton rests under a heavy blanket. {area3_tunnel}
    {area3_treasure}
2   A dilapidated door barely hangs on rusted hinges. Leaves and dirt litter the
    the floor of the 10'x10' hut. {area3_tunnel} {area3_monster}

4   A magical ring of plant control long ago fell through a crack in the floorboards.

# Orchard
table: area4
1   Aging trees bear a few shriveled apples, still edible. {area4_monster}
2   Only the largest limbs of long-dead fruit trees remain, standing pathetically
    over piles of debris. {area4_monster}
3   Verdant trees bear a variety of fruits, including apples and lemons. {area4_monster}
4   Sad stumps in a barren field suggest an orchard once grew here. {area4_monster}

5   {3d10} giant rats dwell in tunnels dug through this area. They can pop in and
    out of holes, surprising 3 in 6 and sometimes ducking back into the warren
    for safety. {monster_giant_rat}

2   The stable is empty and dusty. The glint of something shiny attracts the eye
    that gazes over the field, which is infested with {1d8} giant shrews. They
    will define their home aggressively. Poking out of the dirt is an earring
    that grants +1 CHA.{break2}
    Giant Shrew AC 16, HD 1*, #At 2 bites, Dam 1d6/1d6, Mv 60', Sv F2, Ml 10, XP 37
3   Doves roost in the rafters of the dilapidated stable. Long abandoned stalls
    contain nothing more than descated straw and the bones of a cow.
4   The doors of the stable have fallen from their hinges.

# Garden
table: area6
1   Raised beds meant for a garden have long ago given over to weeds. One bed
    displays towering fungal growth that appears to be dusted with a yellow powder.{break2}
    Yellow Mold AC Can always be hit, HD 2*, #At Spores, Dam See description,
    Mv 0, Sv NM, Ml N/A, XP 100
2   What was once a garden is now a graveyard. Broken masonry stones are propped
    up as grave markers, the painted text long ago washed away by rain. The graves
    are each {1d10}' deep and contain the following.{break2}
    Grave 1 contains {area6_grave}{break}

    inside.
2   No glass remains in any windows. Ragged curtains flutter weakly.
3   Half the panes of glass are missing from windows. Most of the rest are
    shattered. Curtains or drapes obscure views to inside.
4   Windows are of a double-hung type and in good operation. Half are locked.

# Undead / Demons

# Porch
table: area8a
1   Stairs lead up to a 10'x10' porch where sturdy boards hold a door closed. Bold
    letters carved into one of the planks warns "{area8a_warning}". Whithered offerings
    collect before the threshold.
2   The entry door stands ajar, hanging loosely, on the north end of a 10'x10' porch.
    Access is available via stairs from the south. Standing on the creeking boards, a
    stale odor of decay creeps out from deep within the crumbling abode. Flowers and
    herbs scatter over the groaning floorboards, some crushed under unknown feet.
3   A patchwork of rottted stair treads leads to a partially collapsed porch. Careful
    stepping on decaying framework of a 10' square porch allows access to a doorway
    blocked by a door which has fallen from its top hinge and tilted clockwise.
4   Stone stairs lead to a porch covered in wooden planks over which green paint wore
    away under bootheels. A rusting chain loops through a hole in the door, around the door
    frame and back out a hole in the wall where a padlock joins the two ends. Almost
    unreadable, red paint smeared on the ragged door announces, "{area8a_warning}".

# Entry
table: area9a
1   Dim light stabs through the window on the east wall of this entry chamber over a
    well-worn rug and towards a hallway to the west. A closet door to the north invites
    investigation, and a doorway on the south wall allows exit from the building.
2   The main entrance to the house on the south wall faces a closet door on the north
    wall. A window on the east wall offers a view across a path to a garden. To the west,
    a hallway opens up to a parlor. A glass vase has falled from a small alcove, leaving
    glass shards strewn over a moth-eaten rug.


table: area9_closet
1   Beyond the locked closet door hang {2d6} coats, some in severe disrepair. A thorough
    search of pockets will turn up {area9_closet_treasure}.
2   A small closet, five feet square, holds only shreds of unrecognizable garments hanging
    from rusted hooks. A concealed door on the west wall contains {area9_closet_treasure}
    plus a leather sack holding {3d8}00 gp.
3   A leather whip winds around a rod spanning this 5'x10' closet and around the neck of
    a wriggling corpse. It's feet dangling only inches over old floorboards, the zombie
    reaches to the doorway to grab the unexpecting explorer. It will grapple to pull a
    victim in for a satisfying taste of flesh. {monster_zombie}{break2}Inside the breast
    pocket of the zombie's coat searchers find {area9_closet_treasure}.
4   The ceiling of this 5'x10' closet collapsed into a pile of plaster and wood spliters,
    allowing access to area 23 above.

table: area9_closet_treasure
1   a thin bar of soap wrapped in oily rag that when rubbed over a non-magical weapon
    adds a +{1d2} enchantment for {1d6} turns

    wisdom to 18 for {1d6} hours
3   a silver locket hiding a delicate cameo ({3d6}gp)

    hole in the floor. {area10a_hole}.
2   Two figures sit motionless in upolstered chairs. {area10a_residents}

table: area10a_hole
1   A desicated corpse lies motionless among more debris {1d4+1}' below floor level. Anyone
    touching it must save versus poison or be infected by mummy rot.
2   The corpse of a giant rat lies {1d4+1}' below floor level. Movement in this room
    has a {1d4} in 6 chance to draw the attention of {2d6} rats from the nest in the crawlspace
    which expands under the entire footprint of the house. It also provides exits under the
    back porch and down into the basement. Entering the crawlspace triggers the rats to
    defend their nest to the death. {monster_giant_rat}
3   The hole reveals an open, empty casket.


table: area10a_residents
1   The ordinary skeletons tumble into a pile of bones if touched.
2   Skeletons leap to attack, both picking one victim at random to grapple and drag down the
    hall into the kitchen (area 16). {monster_skeleton}
3   Zombies lurch to their feet, attracted to anything magical, which they will attempt to
    take away and then shamble outside to throw down the well. {monster_zombie}
4   Ghouls pause their whispered argument to stare at intruders. {monster_ghoul}

    pulled from inside. Victims take {1d4}d6 damage, save vs death for half.
3   A crawlspace beneath the porch floor offers strategically placed gaps that
    allow a bandit to thrust a dagger upwards in a sneak attack. Floorboards offer
    excellent cover for the bandit who may wisely retreat to a crawlspace if

    child wearing a jeweled necklace (5,000gp). Beneath layers of clothing will
    be found a wooden stake through the heart. If the vampiric child is left out
    in the elements, there is a 1 in 6 chance every day that a scavenging animal
    tears the body up enough to dislodge the stake, bringing the vampire back to
    undeath.
