41-43   Major Earthquake<br>
        In month {1d12}, an earthquake produces extensive destruction in a {1d30+20}-mile-radius, {1d20}
        miles {earthquake-direction} of the home of the PCs. A series of lesser
        tremors come before and after. The big quake destroys cities, reshapes lakes,
        coastlines, and rivers, causes great fires, and possibly kills hundreds
        of people. {earthquake-fire} {earthquake-plague}
44-47   Famine<br>
        Crops wither, animals die, and the poor begin to starve. The famine strikes
        in month {1d12} and lasts for {1d6+1} months. Food prices rise by
        {famine-costs} times normal. Marauders scavenge food of any type. Farms
        produce no income this year and 25% next year. {famine-uprising}
        Population falls by 5% per month. {famine-plague}
48-52   Major Fire<br>
        In month {1d12}, a huge conflagration sweeps a major city of the land,
        destroying {1d4+4}0% of the city. Use this as the chance the PCs lose property.
        The city's population is reduced by {1d4}0%. The price of lumber and
        building materials is ten times normal for the next four months. The price
        of food doubles for one month.
        {fire-plague} {fire-famine}
53-57   Flood<br>
        A major flood sweeps the region in month {1d12}. If on the coast, severe storms cause
        the waters to flood the coastal regions. If along a river, a series of
        heavy rains cause the river to rage and overflow its banks, flooding
        the bottom land. The waters rise {5d6} feet. Signs of the impending
        flood are obvious {1d4+1} days in advance and levees and dikes can be
        built to protect against it. Once the flood begins, the waters rise at
        the rate of half a foot an hour until the maximum is reached. They remain
        at their high point for {4d6} hours and then subside at the rate of
        1 foot per day. Buildings are extensively damaged, although only those
        in the path of the raging waters are destroyed. The population of the
        area is reduced by {1d10}% and the price of all goods is doubled
        for {1d4+1} months. Normal movement across the flooded areas is
        impossible.
        {flood-plague}
        {flood-timing}
58      Major Incursion<br>
        Beginning in month {1d12} and lasting for {1d12} months, a major migration
        of {incursion-creatures} numbering about 1% of the existing population
        enters the kingdom from outside its borders.
        They come {incursion-reason}.
        They try to live life as they always have, retaining old habits and
        speaking their own language.
59-68   Marriage<br>
        The ruler of the land has arranged an important diplomatic marriage
        {marriage-for}, seeking to {marriage-reason}. The marriage is a cause
        for festivals and feasting. The marriage happens in month {1d12}.
69      New Religion<br>

        period of {1d6+1} months. {religion-feud} {religion-fued}

70-74   Plague<br>

75-78   Political Plot<br>
        {plot-discovered} Many nobles and government officials are stripped of
        their rank, banished, or executed. If the PCs are involved in political
        affairs, there is a 40% chance they are accused of complicity. If the
        characters have powerful enemies, this chance is increased to 80%.
        {plot-nobles}
        Spies and secret police are everywhere, ready to arrest people
        on the slightest evidence. The political turmoil begins in month {1d12}
        and lasts for {1d3} months.
79-85   Rebellion<br>
        {rebel-group} attempts to overthrow the government.
        The purpose of the rebellion is {rebel-aim}.
        The rebellion begins in month {1d12} and last {1d6} months.
86      Tsunami<br>
        In month {1d12}, a great wave, {1d11+9}0 feet high, strikes a 50-mile section of coastline.
        It strikes with little warning. The population of the area is reduced
        by 70%.
        (Countries without coastlines treat this event as no event for the year.)
        For {1d2} months afterwards, the price of building materials
        triples, and the price of all other goods doubles.
        {tsunami-plague}

        In month {1d12}, {volcano-appears}. The eruption is preceded by
        tremors and rumblings identical to those that precede a major earthquake.
        When the eruption occurs, it is of exceptional violence. All within a
        5-mile radius is destroyed and clouds of thick ash rain down up to
        30 miles downwind. The volcano spews smoke and ash for the remainder
        of the month. Thereafter, the volcano remains active for {1d12} months,
        with a 10% chance per month of another major eruption.
