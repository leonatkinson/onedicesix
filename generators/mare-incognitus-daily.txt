1   Kraken AC 20, HD 36** (+16), #At 10 tentacles or 1 bite, Dam 7d6(x10) or 4d6, Mv Swim 40', Sv F20, Ml 11, XP 18450<br>
    100' long. 10 tentacles that reach 500'. Once hit, tentacle wraps around you and automatically does 7d6 each round.
    Victim is -4 to attack when wrapped up. Do 60 damage to sever a tentacle.
    Can wrap a ship with six tentacles to do 4d6 damage per round. Will flee if
    it loses half of its tentacles. Can jet away at 280' in a cloud of ink.
2   Dragon Turtle AC 22, HD 30** (AB+15), #At 2 claws/1 bite or breath,
    Dam 2d8/2d8/10d6 or 30d8, Mv 10' (10') Swim 30' (15'), Sv F20 at +5, Ml 10, XP 13650<br>
    Breath steam 30/day. 100' x 75'.
3   The Great Storm Wyrm AC 18, HD 30** (+15), #At 1 bite, 2 claws, 1 tail lash,
    Dam 6d8 bite, 4d6 claw (x2), 5d6 tail, Mv Fly 20', Swim 60', Sv F18, Ml 10, XP 13650<br>
    Approximately 200' long with a 300' wingspan. This serpentine dragon dwells
    in the deepest trenches and can erupt from the sea with surprising speed.
    Its scales shimmer with embedded minerals that crackle with electrical energy.
    Its bite can discharge a bolt of lightning (3d8 damage, save vs. Paralysis for half).
    Its claws can tear through hulls, and its massive tail can sweep across a deck,
    potentially knocking creatures overboard (save vs. Strength to hold fast).
    When it dives, it creates a whirlpool
    (treat as difficult terrain for 1 round in a 100' radius). It will likely
    retreat if it sustains significant damage, diving back into the crushing depths.
4   Giant Deep-Dweller Octopus AC 16 (natural armor), HD 32** (+15), #At 8 tentacles
    and 1 bite, Dam 5d6 (x8) and 3d8, Mv Swim 50', Sv F17, Ml 9, XP 16800<br>
    Approximately 150' across with tentacles reaching up to 600'. This colossal
    octopus lurks in abyssal trenches and can rise to attack surface vessels.
    Its eight massive tentacles are covered in rows of powerful suckers that
    automatically inflict 5d6 damage on a successful hit and constrict the victim,
    causing an additional 3d6 damage per round until freed
    (requires a successful Strength check at -2 penalty or dealing 40 damage
    to the tentacle). Its beak-like bite can crush through wooden hulls.
    The giant octopus can also expel a cloud of inky darkness in a 60' radius,
    obscuring vision (treat as total darkness). It will retreat to the depths
    if it loses four or more tentacles.
5   The Chorale of Coral and Bone AC 19 (chitinous plates), HD 40** (+17),
    #At 4 resonant limbs and sonic shriek, Dam 4d8 (x4) and special, Mv Swim 30', Sv F22, Ml 12, XP 20550<br>
    This gargantuan entity resembles a vast, slowly rotating mass of fused coral,
    bleached bones, and the remnants of sunken ships, easily 300' in diameter.
    Four immense, articulated limbs, tipped with clusters of resonating crystal
    chimes, extend from its central mass. These limbs do crushing damage, but
    their primary function is to generate complex sonic vibrations. Each round,
    the Chorale emits a disorienting and damaging sonic shriek in a 200' radius.
    Creatures caught in the shriek must make a Save vs. Paralysis or be stunned
    for 1d4 rounds and suffer 6d6 sonic damage (Save halves damage, no stun).
    The Chorale has no discernible eyes or mouth, seemingly sensing its surroundings
    through vibrations in the water. Severing a resonant limb requires 80 damage
    and disrupts its sonic output (reducing damage and stun chance). Its movement
    is ponderous, but its sonic attacks can cripple entire vessels. The disturbing
    aspect is its seemingly inorganic nature, a living ecosystem of death and
    decay that sings a deadly, silent song.

table: castaway 1d10
1   A gruff dwarf named Borin was marooned after his pirate crew raided a dwarven
    ruin and faced animated defenses, tossing him overboard during their escape.
    He survives by a small spring and tough roots, guarding a humming metal box
    salvaged from the wreck amidst ancient dwarven remnants. Borin seeks passage,
    offering the box's contents, claiming trinkets, in exchange.
2   A nervous halfling, Pippin, stowed away on a smuggling ship and was dropped
    here by a monstrous flying creature. He hides in caves and scavenges shellfish,
    leaving giant bird tracks around a foul nest. Pippin possesses a crude map to
    a larger island westward and will share it for help escaping the bird.
3   Lyra, a scarred smuggler captain, survived her ship breaking apart in a magical storm.
    She's built a camp from wreckage and fishes with sharpened sticks, with a
    locked strongbox among the debris and a glowing crystal shard she found.
    Lyra wants to recover the strongbox, offering a share of its contents,
    mostly coins she claims, for passage.
4   An arrogant high elf named Faelan was shipwrecked by an intelligent octopus
    while seeking rare flora. He uses illusion magic for food and collects rainwater,
    surrounded by glowing moss and nightly clicking sounds. Faelan carries
    luminescent flower petals and will reluctantly cooperate, offering arcane
    plant knowledge for escape.
5   A shifty goblin named Griknuk jumped ship during a pirate ambush and drifted here.
    He burrows in dunes and eats small creatures, with hidden caches of shiny
    trinkets and stolen coins. A large, sharp-clawed sand crab patrols the shore,
    and Griknuk will reveal his treasures for safe passage and protection.
6   Elias, a weathered scholar, was marooned by his mutinous crew after seeking
    ancient ruins. He survives on foraged plants, sometimes toxic, near a partially
    buried stone structure covered in strange symbols he meticulously documents.
    Elias desperately wants to continue his research and offers his knowledge
    of the ruins for rescue.
7   Grok, a hulking half-orc gladiator, was forced onto a ship and thrown
    overboard during a sea serpent attack. His strength allows him to break
    shellfish, and he shelters in a cave, near the massive shed skin of a serpent
    and giant footprints. Grok wears a broken iron collar and will offer his
    strength for passage and its removal.
8   A mysterious masked figure in dark robes, claiming "divine reckoning,"
    refuses to explain their arrival. They seem to need little sustenance,
    often in a trance, amidst geometric patterns etched in the sand. A faint
    humming emanates from a black stone they possess, and they want the adventurers
    to take it to a star constellation's location.
9   Isla, a young woman clutching a broken lute, survived a magical whirlpool
    that destroyed her ship and companions. She found water and fruit, singing
    sadly amidst scattered instruments and stage props. Isla claims to see strange
    lights at night and longs for company and safe passage, offering her music.
10  Zix, a surprisingly clean goblin tinkerer, ended up here when his
    self-propelled submersible malfunctioned. He uses salvaged parts for water
    and traps, surrounded by gears and contraptions. Zix needs specific
    components to repair his invention or build a new escape, offering his
    technical skills for help.

table: small-island 1d10
1   The Isle of Whispering Bones appears as a typical tropical island at first
    glance, but a constant, low murmur permeates the air, the collective sighs of
    countless skeletons half-buried in the sand. These are the remains of those
    who sought a legendary spring said to grant eternal youth, only to find it
    guarded by a creature that drains life force, leaving animated husks that
    eventually collapse. The island holds the dry, brittle petals of a flower
    that blooms only near the spring.  Eating them temporarily wards off the
    life-draining entity.
2   The Obsidian Spire Island is dominated by a colossal, impossibly smooth
    black tower that pierces the clouds, radiating an unnatural chill. Strange,
    bioluminescent insects flit around its base, and the surrounding jungle is
    unnaturally silent. The spire is a dormant bio-construct from a long-vanished
    civilization, and within its depths lies a library of forgotten technology,
    potentially powerful artifacts or dangerous knowledge. The island projects
    the feeling of being watched by an unblinking, alien intelligence, a sense
    that the island itself is a sleeping giant that could awaken at any moment.
3   The Coral Labyrinth of Lost Souls is a sprawling network of razor-sharp coral
    formations that creates disorienting passages and echoing chambers above and
    below the water. Within this maze dwell spectral figures, the tormented
    spirits of sailors lost to the Mare Incognitus, forever searching for a way
    out. At the heart of the labyrinth is a still pool where the veil between
    worlds is thin. A ritual performed with tears of the living and coral dust
    can temporarily grant communication with the dead, offering valuable
    information or terrible warnings. Here there is a palpable sense of unending sorrow
    and the feeling of being surrounded by the silent screams of the departed.
4   The Isle of Shifting Sands never remains the same for long, dunes rearranging
    themselves as if alive, revealing and concealing strange, cyclopean ruins
    that seem to sink and reappear with the tides of sand. Travelers might
    stumble upon intricate devices that hum with an unknown energy or murals
    depicting beings with far too many limbs and eyes. Those who linger too
    long find their memories becoming unreliable, their sense of direction
    failing, as if the very land is subtly altering their minds. The true
    treasure might be the key to understanding the sand's strange sentience,
    or escaping its disorienting influence.
5   The Gilded Cage Island appears as a paradise, lush vegetation surrounding
    a breathtaking waterfall that cascades into a crystal-clear lagoon. Beautiful,
    exotic birds sing melodic tunes, and strange, sweet fruits grow in abundance.
    However, the island is encircled by an invisible barrier, shimmering faintly
    in the sunlight, that prevents any departure. Within this idyllic prison
    live ageless humanoids with serene smiles, who offer endless hospitality
    but speak of a benevolent "caretaker" who will one day release them, their
    eyes holding a deep, unsettling emptiness.
6   From afar, the Isle of Perpetual Bloom seems a vibrant tapestry of exotic
    flowers, their scents carrying on the breeze for miles. Upon closer inspection,
    the blossoms are unnaturally large and intricate, some pulsing with a faint
    light. Strange, insectile creatures with human-like faces tend to the flora
    with unnerving devotion. At the island's center lies a colossal, immobile
    plant that seems to breathe slowly, its petals unfurling to reveal
    unsettlingly familiar features. The pollen has a strange effect on visitors,
    inducing vivid, shared dreams and a growing sense of unity with the island's
    bizarre ecosystem.
7   The Isle of Thunder echoes with roars that predate humanity, its dense jungle
    canopy concealing creatures thought long extinct. Giant ferns and towering
    cycads create a primeval landscape where armored herbivores graze in misty
    valleys and swift predators stalk through the undergrowth. Ancient ruins,
    overgrown and crumbling, hint at a forgotten civilization that once coexisted
    with these behemoths, perhaps even controlling them. A valuable find might
    be intact technology from this era, designed to interact with the dinosaurs,
    or even fossilized remains of unique species found nowhere else.
8   The Isle of Sunken Idols rises from the waves as a jagged collection of black,
    slick rocks, perpetually damp and smelling of brine and decay. Crude,
    cyclopean structures of a non-Euclidean geometry cling to the cliffsides,
    their surfaces covered in unsettling carvings of fish-like humanoids and
    impossible aquatic deities. The air is thick with a guttural croaking and
    the scraping of webbed feet, the sounds of Gogglers moving between tide pools
    and shadowy caves. A hidden grotto at the island's heart contains a pulsating,
    obsidian obelisk covered in strange glyphs, radiating a palpable aura of
    ancient, malevolent power, a focal point for their abhorrent rituals. Any
    treasure here is likely tainted, either guarded by the Gogglers or imbued
    with their alien, unsettling influence.
9   A lush, verdant island, seemingly untouched by the dangers of Mare Incongnitus,
    is known as Menagerie Isle. Here, the eccentric Lord Valerius Thorne, a man
    of unnerving charm and formidable intellect, maintains a sprawling collection
    of exotic creatures and surprisingly, captured adventurers. Thorne employs
    a combination of ingenious, magically-enhanced traps disguised as natural
    terrain, potent soporific gas released through hidden vents in the jungle,
    and artifacts that induce paralysis or mental domination. His most effective
    tool, however, is a set of intricately crafted silver whistles that emit
    frequencies capable of subduing even magically resistant beings, exploiting
    subtle vulnerabilities in their physiology or will. Thorne views his
    collection as a grand experiment in apex predators and their interactions,
    meticulously documenting their behavior within his carefully controlled
    environment.
10  The Isle of Chimeras reeks of antiseptic and something vaguely organic, a
    sickly sweet odor that hangs heavy in the humid air. Scattered across the
    island are crude laboratories built from salvaged shipwrecks and strange,
    pulsating machinery powered by unknown energies. Within these makeshift
    workshops, bubbling vats hold grotesque humanoids in various stages of
    development, limbs of beasts grafted onto human torsos, eyes of birds
    staring from human skulls. Dr. Alistair Finch, a gaunt figure with wild
    eyes and bloodstained hands, oversees his horrific creations, driven by a
    twisted pursuit of biological perfection. He uses crude surgical techniques,
    arcane science, and possibly even captured magical energies to fuse disparate
    life forms. His blatant disregard for life contrasts with the agonizing
    existence of these unnatural beings, trapped between human and animal,
    their pained moans echoing through the unnatural jungle. The value here
    might be Finch's research notes, detailing his unsettling methods, or
    perhaps a way to end the suffering of his failed experiments.
