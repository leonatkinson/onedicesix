table: deadly_blow 2d6 Result of Deadly Blow
2       <strong>Instant Death!</strong><br>
        The PC suffers multiple and extensive injuries,
        expiring immediately.
3       <strong>Fatal Wound!</strong><br>
        Blow to {deadly_blow_location}. The wound is fatal, but the PC wonâ€™t
        actually die for another {1d20}0 minutes. Only a wish can stop the
        impending hand of doom. Make a Save vs. Death to determine if the PC
        can remain conscious. Even so, the PC can do nothing more than speak or
        crawl slowly. If the killing blow was to a limb, it is useless or
        severed. Blows to the eyes blind the PC. Blows to the ears deafen the
        PC.
4-5     <strong>Severed Body {deadly_blow_location}!</strong><br>
        The killing blow has separated a limb or other body part from the rest
        of the body. Blades make clean cuts. Crushing weapons turn flesh and
        bone to mush. Puncture wounds sever a major blood vessel, causing the
        limb to become paralyzed and to later shrivel and die. Other types of
        damage, such as fire or acid, burn away flesh over a large area to
        produce a similar effect. In all cases, the limb is lost without
        magical regeneration.<br>
        <br>
        If the hit location is the skull or neck and the
        character wears no helmet, treat this result as a roll of 2 (Instant
        Death). If the hit location is the trunk (chest, back, gut), and the
        character wears no armor, treat this result as a roll of 3 (Fatal
        Wound). Otherwise, the character will <strong>die of bleeding in {1d6+2} rounds</strong>.
        Make a Save vs. Death to determine if the PC can remain conscious.<br>
        <br>
        If the hit location is to the trunk, a large chunk of flesh is
        destroyed. Skin may grow back over the wound, but it will always look
        grotesque. The area is permanently weak, and any later blow to this
        spot will instantly kill the character.<br>
        <br>
        Bleeding characters may be saved with healing magic, a tourniquet, or
        cauterization with fire, except that cauterization will not stop
        bleeding caused by burns.<br>
        <br>
        Surviving characters require {3d6} weeks to recover. Until this time, the
        character can do nothing more strenuous than walk or speak.
6-7     <strong>Broken Bone in {deadly_blow_location}!</strong><br>
        The killing blow has shattered the bones indicated by Hit Location,
        producing an audible snap or grinding sound. In some cases, the broken
        bone may be protruding from the flesh. The PC falls <strong>unconscious
        for {1d20} rounds</strong> unless a Save vs. Death Ray is made.<br>
        <br>
        If Hit Location is the head and no helmet is worn, Save vs Death Ray or
        fall into a coma. Otherwise, <strong>the bone heals after {3d6}
        weeks</strong>, during which time the limb cannot be used. Characters
        with broken legs or feet cannot stand or walk. Comatose PCs remain in
        the coma until the bone heals.<br>
        <br>
        Broken bones of the arms, legs or chest reduce carrying capacity by
        half. If the hit location is the the back, the character is permanently
        paralyzed and unable to walk. If hit location is the chest, broken ribs
        will prevent strenuous activity for the duration of recovery. A broken
        bone of the gut ruptures an internal organ.
8-9     <strong>Knocked Out!</strong><br>
        A blow to the head had rendered the PC <strong>unconscious for {1d12}
        rounds</strong>, unless no helmet is worn, in which case treat as a
        Broken Bone to {deadly_blow_location}. After regaining consciousness,
        the PC wakes up with <strong>{1d4} hit points</strong>.
10-11   <strong>Stunned!</strong><br>
        The PC is <strong>stunned for {1d4} rounds</strong> as a blow to the
        head dislodges the helmet, which tumbles {2d6} feet away. If no helmet
        is worn, the PC is <strong>knocked unconscious for 1d12 rounds</strong>.<br>
        <br>
        Stunned PCs experience dizziness, ringing in the ears and blurred
        vision. Movement is halved. Ability bonuses are reduced to -3 for
        Dexterity, Intelligence, and Charisma. Attacks suffer a -4 penalty.<br>
        <br>
        After regaining consciousness, the PC wakes up with <strong>{1d4} hit points</strong>.
12      <strong>Rage!</strong><br>
        A raging fury pushes back against the injury, returning the PC to {1d4}
        hit points. When combat ends, hit points are reduced to zero, and the
        PC faints for {2d6} rounds.<br>
        <br>
        If a PC achieves this result for a second time during a single combat,
        a berserker effect is produced similar to a potion of heroism. The PC
        gains a +3 attack bonus and {3d8} temporary hit points for the duration
        of the combat.
