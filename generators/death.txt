table: deadly_blow 2d6 Result of Deadly Blow
2       Instant Death from blow to {deadly_blow_location}! The character is dead
        with no Save vs Death.
3       Fatal Wound! The character dies in {1d20}0 minutes.<br>
        <br>
        Only a wish or similar effect can heal wound. Knocked Out until death
        unless Save vs Death is made. If the character makes the save, they are
        conscious and can move feebly but cannot fight or perform otherwise
        strenuous actions.<br>
        <br>
        Location of wound is {deadly_blow_location}. Any limb struck is
        completely useless. If hit in the head, the character is
        {deadly_blow_head}.
4-5     Severed  {deadly_blow_location}!<br>
        <br>
        Blades sever limbs. Crushing weapons
        turn flesh and bone to mush. Puncture wounds severe a major blood vessel,
        causing the limb to become paralyzed and to later shrivel and die. Other
        types of damage, such as fire or acid, burns away flesh over a large area
        to produce a similar effect. In all cases, the limb is lost without magical
        regeneration.<br>
        <br>
        If hit location is the head and the character wears no helmet, treat
        this result as a roll of 2, Instant Death. If the hit location is the
        trunk, and the character wears no armor, treat this result as a roll of
        3, Fatal Wound. Otherwise, the character will die of bleeding in
        {1d6+2} rounds. If the hit location is to the trunk (6-40), a large
        chunk of flesh is destroyed. Skin may grow back over the wound, but it
        will always look grotesque. The area is permanently weak and any blow
        to this spot will instantly kill the character.<br>
        <br>
        Bleeding characters may be saved with healing magic, a tourniquet, or
        cauterization with fire, except that cauterization will not stop
        bleeding caused by burns. Surviving characters require {3d6} weeks to
        recover. Knocked Out until death unless Save vs Death is made.
6-7     Broken Bone in {deadly_blow_location}! Knocked Out {1d20} rounds unless
        Save vs Death is made.<br>
        <br>
        If hit location is the head (1-5) and no helmet is worn, Save vs Death
        or fall into a coma. Otherwise, {3d6} weeks to heal before the limb can
        be used. Character with broken legs or feet cannot stand or walk. If
        hit location is the the back, the character is permanently paralyzed
        and unable to walk. If hit location is the chest, broken ribs will
        prevent strenuous activity for the duration of recovery.
8-9     Knocked Out for {1d12} rounds from a blow to the head if wearing a helm!
        If no helmet, then treat as a Broken Bone in {deadly_blow_location}.
10-11   Stunned for {1d4} rounds and lose helm if wearing helm. Knocked Out for
        {1d12} rounds if not wearing helm.
12      Rage: A surge of adrenaline returns {1d4} hit points per hit die. At the
        end of the combat, the adrenaline drains away, hit points are reduced to
        zero, and the PC faints for {2d6} rounds. If you roll this more than once in a
        single combat consider yourself a Bezerker under the effects of a potion of
        super-heroism.
