table: material 1d20
1   of seamless, black stone, reflecting no light
2   hewn from immense, grey granite blocks, worn by wind
3   a spiral of dull, rust-colored metal, riveted together
4   constructed from rough-cut, dark green serpentine
5   a patchwork of uneven, crimson-stained bricks
6   a slender spire of smooth, bone-white ceramic
7   of dark, petrified wood, gnarled and ancient-looking
8   a massive column of polished, veined marble
9   built of dark, unmortared flagstones, perfectly fitted
10  a stark cylinder of unadorned, grey concrete
11  of tightly packed, dark earth, reinforced with thick timbers
12  a blocky structure of dark, rough volcanic rock
13  of intricately carved, dark oak, aged to nearly black
14  a cluster of hexagonal columns, like dark basalt
15  a tall structure of stacked, dark river stones
16  of rough-hewn slate, overlapping in dark layers
17  a forbidding pillar of dark, unpolished iron
18  constructed from dark, vitrified sand, smooth and glassy
19  a stark edifice of dark, porous sandstone
20  of dark, unidentifiable material, appearing to absorb light

table: shaped 1d20
1-6     round, {3d6}0' across
7-11    square, {3d6}0' across
12-15   rectangular, {3d6}0' x {3d6}0' at the base
16-17   gently conical, {3d6}0' at the base and {1d8+2}0' narrower at the top
18-19   pyramid-shaped, {3d6}0' square at the base
20      irregularly-shaped, a collection of blobs stacked atop each other

table: entrance 1d20
1-2     a heavy iron door, bolted from within
3-4     a rough-hewn arch, cloaked in shadow
5       a circular portal, glowing faintly
6       a pair of massive, brass-bound gates
7       an opening like a mouth, lined with unseen teeth
8       a narrow slit, just wide enough to squeeze through
9-10    a single, unmarked wooden door, set deep
11      a swirling vortex of muted colors
12      unseen, merely unbroken stone
13      a suspended platform, {2d6}0' above the ground
14      a pair of smooth, black panels, perfectly flush
15      a heavy iron gate
16      a stone slab with runes
17      an illusionary wall
18      a teleportation circle at the base of the tower
19-20   a drawbridge over {moat}

table: moat
1   a dry ditch
2   a water-filled moat
3   a marshy moat, with sections of deep mud
4   a dry ditch filled with sharpened spikes

table: entrance-protection 1d6
1-2     {entrance-trap}
3-4     {entrance-guard}
5       {entrance-trap} Additionally, {entrance-guard}
6       Entrance into the tower is not protected.

table: entrance-trap
1   An invisible magical ward was placed on the threshold that triggers an
    explosion (4d6 damage) and sleep (Save vs spells +WIS, 1d4 min unconscious)
    upon unauthorized entry. It may be disabled by a specific, complex hand
    gesture and whispered command, known only to the wizard.
2   A subtle, recessed pressure plate near the entrance triggers a volley of
    darts (2d4 attacks AB+25, plus save vs. poison) from hidden launchers.
    It may be disabled for 1 turn by placing approximately 50 lbs on the plate
    for 1 minute.
3   Stepping through triggers a 30' pitfall. It can be disabled by touching the
    wall while speaking a specific passphrase.
4   The entrance is protected by a temporal stasis field. Individuals entering
    are greatly slowed for 1d6 turns. This effect may be disabled by tracing a
    specific runic pattern in the air, briefly disrupting the field.
5   The door is magically sealed with Wizard Lock, tied to an alarm. Unauthorized
    lock attempts trigger a piercing shriek, alerting inhabitants and stunning
    (save vs spell +CON or paralyzed 1d6 rounds). It can be disabled by passing
    a small iron key over the lock.
6   An invisible psychic barrier covers the entrance. Unauthorized passage
    requires an INT check or take 4d6 psychic damage and suffer disadvantage on
    all mental tasks for 1d4 hours. It may be bypassed by holding a piece of
    raw amethyst over one's brow while passing through.
