1   The PCs receive an invitation to a contest from a powerful lord. The
    contest is in one of the arts (poetry, painting, calligraphy) and will
    happen in {1d20} days. The contest takes the form of a formal party. Each
    guest composes a work on the spot that is then judged according to the
    quality of the work, the appropriateness to the occasion, the imagery, and
    the sheer beauty. The winner of the contest receives a minor gift and gains

table: small-fire 1d1
1   A fire breaks out in a building not far from the PCs. They are expected to
    aid in the firefighting. This may mean organizing the work or simply being

    characters are at home, one of their buildings will be on fire. If not
    fought quickly and effectively, the fire will burn out of control.

    its course. Each day untreated, the sick person becomes worse in condition.
    At the end of the time period, if the disease has not been cured, a saving
    throw versus death must be made. If the save is failed, the invalid dies. If
    the saving throw is made, the person begins to recover. Sick characters are
    required to rest and recover {2d6} days.

table: insult 1d1
1   One of the PCs, intentionally or inadvertently, insults an NPC. If the NPC
    is of the player character's status or higher, he demands satisfaction. If
    this occurs at a court, the aggrieved party presents his complaint to the
    ruling lord, who takes some type of action on it. Should this punishment be
    inadequate or the aggrieved is of lower standing, the player character has
    made a long-term enemy who will attempt to cause harm in the future.

table: invitation 1d1
1   The player characters have received an order, politely phrased as an
    invitation to call upon a powerful lord. The purpose is
    {invitation-reason}. These invitations are by no means casual affairs.

    section of the coast of their intended destination, an island along their
    course, or some small uncharted island. Such uncharted lands are certainly
    filled with all manner of unusual and dangerous creatures (perhaps even
    dinosaurs and gargantua!).

table: maiden 1d1
1   A young woman of exceptional grace, wit, and beauty has appeared in the region.
    She is {maiden-who}. She charms and impresses all who meet her. She has an
    exceptionally fine writing style that reveals her pure nature. She is skilled
    in the playing of musical instruments and other artistic accomplishments.
    She is properly respectful of her parents (if she has any). If the maiden
    is any but the daughter of a powerful noble, she can be courted
    (and possibly wed) without the full formalities. However, being aware
    (but not vain) of her own qualities, she does not accept just anyone. Her
    accepted suitor must possess exceptional qualities of his own. He must also
    be a model of virtue and likewise skilled in the arts. He must possess heroic
    qualities. To even attract her notice, he must produce some artistic item of
    quality-a poem, painting, exceptional handwriting, etc. He must have a
    Charisma of at least 13. Maidens of mysterious origin or princesses may set
    impossible tasks as a condition for any successful suitor. The social rank
    of the character is not as important as the qualities mentioned above.

        are traveling on foot, with the nobles carried in palanquins.

        a powerful enemy. They are either on foot and dressed as common
        peasants, or mounted dressed as wandering samurai and bushi. If dressed

        appropriately humble fashion.

    exhausting and exposed characters suffer 1-2 points of damage per hour.

table: stranger 1d1
1   An unknown NPC, {stranger-type}, encounters the party and displays an
