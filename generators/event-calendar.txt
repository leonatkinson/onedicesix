    area of the quake will be damaged. {monthly-earthquake-fire} The earthquake is

    the earthquake, the cost of building materials doubles for {1d2} months.

table: excessive-taxes 1d1
1   Taxes soar to crushing heights, squeezing every last coin from the poorest
    peasants. Families are torn apart as debt-slavery claims those unable to pay,
    and once-proud farmers are forced to sell their ancestral lands for a pittance,
    joining the ranks of beggars in the streets. Desperation breeds cunning.
    Villagers hide their meager goods, forge petitions for mercy, and whisper of
    secret exemptions. The air is thick with resentment and fear as the tax
    collectors make their rounds. {taxes-uprising} {taxes-bandits}

    The person is noted for {famous-person-reason}. The visitor attempts to arrive

table: flooding 1d1
1   Flooding erupts as {flooding-cause} unleashes a roaring wall of water on the {dom} day of the month.
    A surging wave, {5d4} feet high and {1d100+100} feet wide, bursts from the
    riverbed and thunders across the countryside. The torrent carves a path of
    devastation for {1d6} miles, sweeping away all in its wake—fields, homes,
    livestock, and the unwary. Any caught in the flood’s path are hurled
    downstream to their doom unless they cling to a raft or some desperate
    flotation. When the fury subsides, the land is left sodden, water lingering
    at {2d4} inches deep. The floodwaters remain until the shattered barrier is
    rebuilt or the sun finally dries the land.

table: horrendous-monster 1d1
1   On the {dom} day of the month, a monstrous being of unspeakable power slithers into the region, casting a
    pall of dread over every village and farmstead. Its lair—some forsaken ruin,
    cavern, or ancient tomb—lies hidden in the wilds, whispered of but never
    approached. The peasants know the general area, but none dare confront the
    horror, paralyzed by tales of vanished hunters and shattered heroes. Each
    night, the monster prowls, leaving behind mutilated livestock, burned fields,
    and cryptic symbols scrawled in blood. As hope fades, desperate villagers
    heap offerings at the edge of the monster’s domain, praying for mercy. If
    left unchecked, the evil deepens. Others of its kind are drawn to the land,
    and the countryside becomes a blighted realm of terror and ruin.

table: major-incursion 1d1

table: injustice 1d1
1       The shadow of injustice falls across the land. In the halls of power, 
        venal magistrates and scheming officials twist the law to their own ends, 
        condemning the innocent while the guilty walk free. On the {dom} day of the month, 
        the people realize {injustice-cause} 
        {injustice-pcs} Rumors of wrongful imprisonment and cruel punishments 
        spread like wildfire, sowing fear and resentment among the people. Only 
        the intervention of brave souls or irrefutable evidence brought before 
        higher authorities can hope to break the grip of corruption and restore 
        justice to the realm.

table: landslide 1d1
1       On the {dom} day of the month, a thunderous landslide or avalanche crashes down from the mountains, 
        burying a vital road beneath tons of earth and shattered stone. The 
        route vanishes beneath a tangled ruin of boulders, uprooted trees, 
        and choking mud. Villages on either side are cut off, their trade 
        and lifelines severed. Only the backbreaking labor of hundreds of 
        peasants, toiling day and night, can hope to clear the way, a task 
        that will take {1d2} weeks of sweat and determination.

table: maiden-of-virtue 1d1
1   On the {dom} day of the month, a young woman of exceptional grace, wit, and beauty has appeared in the region.
    She is {maiden-who}. She charms and impresses all who meet her. She has an
    exceptionally fine writing style that reveals her pure nature. She is skilled
    in the playing of musical instruments and other artistic accomplishments.
    She is properly respectful of her parents, {maiden-parents}.
    ; ;
    If the maiden
    is any but the daughter of a powerful noble, she can be courted without 
    usual formalities. However, being aware of her own qualities, she does not 
    accept just anyone. Her
    accepted suitor must possess exceptional qualities of his own. He must also
    be a model of virtue and likewise skilled in the arts. He must possess heroic
    qualities. To even attract her notice, he must produce some artistic item of
    quality &mdash; a poem, painting, exceptional handwriting, etc. He must have a
    Charisma of at least 13.
    ; ;
    Maidens of mysterious origin or princesses may set
    impossible tasks as a condition for any successful suitor. The social rank
    of the character is not as important as the qualities mentioned above.

table: major-battle 1d1
1   On the {dom} day of the month, a momentous battle erupts in the region, shaking the land to its core. In the
    days leading up to the clash, columns of grim-faced soldiers march through
    villages, requisitioning supplies and filling the air with the tramp of boots
    and the clang of armor. When the armies finally meet, the earth is churned to
    mud beneath the weight of thousands, and the sky is blackened by smoke and
    the cries of the dying. In the aftermath, the defeated scatter in desperate
    flight, some cut down by vengeful peasants defending their homes, others
    hunted by relentless patrols of the victors. The countryside is left scarred,
    haunted by the memory of blood and thunder.

table: maneater 1d1
1   Beginning around the {dom} day of the month, a {maneater-creature} stalks the region, its hunger for human flesh
    turning once-peaceful villages into haunted, silent places. Each week,
    it snatches women, children, or lone farmers from fields and doorways,
    leaving behind only blood and terror. The beast’s attacks are swift and
    merciless. Bodies vanish, and the woods echo with distant, desperate
    screams. Fear grips the countryside. Doors are barred at dusk, fires
    burn through the night, and no one dares walk alone. Despairing
    villagers beg for salvation from the authorities, a wandering hero, or
    the player characters. The maneater’s reign of terror will not end
    until it is hunted down and slain.

table: plague-month 1d1
1   Starting on the {dom} day of the month, a terrible disease sweeps the land, lasting for {2d6} months.
    The population falls by 5% per month. Those untouched by the disease and
    those of neighboring lands are suspicious of strangers. Traders do not enter
    plagued lands and the cost of imported goods increases five times. The cost
    of normal goods doubles. Each month, {5d5}% of population centers become
    infected and {6d5}% of population centers rid themselves of the disease.

table: recruiting 1d1
1   On the {dom} day of the month, the drums of war echo through the land. Heralds ride out, and grim-faced
    officials sweep the villages, rounding up able-bodied men for the army.
    Peasant families are torn apart as enforced levies drag sons from their
    homes. Bounties tempt ambitious officers, and ruthless recruiting gangs
    prowl the countryside, snatching up any who hesitate. The air is thick
    with dread and the promise of glory. {recruiting-pcs}

    No repayment can be expected for this, although notes may be issued for items
    taken. {troop-arrest} Friendly troops do not engage in wholesale pillaging
    and neither do enemy troops (most of the time). Barbarians and enemies on
    raids burn buildings and cause as much damage as possible in addition to
    carrying off anything of value.

table: uprising 1d1
1   On the {dom} day of the month, peasants rise spontaneously in rebellion. They protest against
    {uprising-protest}. Beginning in one villages, the uprising spreads quickly
    to the other rural areas. The peasants arm themselves with whatever is at
    hand, including farm implements and weapons they have gathered from fighters they
    have hunted down. Only 10% of the peasants involved have proper armor.
    {uprising-support} The peasants have no military plan or strategy, simply
    attacking and ambushing any troops and officials of the government they
    find. If a strong leader should arrive in their midst, they can be trained
    into an effective fighting force in {2d2} months.
    ; ;
    Of course, uprisings are
    dealt with severely by the government and reinforcement troops are
    dispatched to deal with them. No mercy or quarter is shown, a fact that
    causes the peasants to fight to the death. {uprising-outcome}
